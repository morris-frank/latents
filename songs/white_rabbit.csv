One pill makes you larger
And one pill makes you small
And the ones that mother gives you
Don't do anything at all
Go ask Alice when she's ten feet tall


And if you go chasing rabbits
And you know you're bound to fall
Well, tell 'em a hookah, a smoking caterpillar
Has given you the call
Call Alice when she was just small

When men on the chessboard
Get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving slow
Go ask Alice, I think she'll know


When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead
And the white knight is talking backward
And the red queen, she's off with her head
Remember what the dormouse said
Feed your head, feed your head, feed your head
